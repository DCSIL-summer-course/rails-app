Hi,

I thought I’d give a brief update into how the workshops are going and my progress in general. This past week I did two workshops, 1) “Getting Started” and 2) “Ruby on Rails part 1”. Additionally, I met with 3 teams and helped them with technical decisions based on their product’s specifications.

The biggest takeaway for me was that the students’ technical skills are highly variable and while some students kept up during the workshop, others did not. After the second workshop I talked to a couple eager students and asked for some feedback. Based on their suggestions I created a detailed walk through of the 2nd tech workshop (including commands and code). This has the added benefit of allowing students who can’t come during the day to follow along. 

My goal with the next few workshops is ensuring that all students can keep up while keeping the more experience students challenged.

This Tuesday Mike Spears (MADlab) will give a workshop on iOS and Xcode development. On Thursday I’ll give part-2 of the Ruby on Rails workshops. 

Tomorrow night I will send out emails to tech mentors connecting them with their respective groups.

Best,
Liam
